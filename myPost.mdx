A **copypasta** is a block 🌚😈🔮💯 of text 📃 that 🍆👀 is copied 😀 and pasted across 😏 the Internet 🌐 by ⏩ individuals through 🧑‍⚖️ online 💻❓ forums and social 👥 networking websites. Copypastas are said 💬 to be 🧐❤️ similar 👱 to spam as they 💁 are often 🍆💰💰 used 📅😏 to annoy other 🏭 users 🏻 and disrupt online 💻❓ discourse. The term 📄 “copypasta” is said 💬🙈 to have 🔦 emerged 📳 from 😤 4chan 🍀 forums around 🤏 2006. Here, 🈁 copypasta was originally 🔙🔙 used 🎶 to mock or provoke new 🆕 users, who 🤔🤔 generally respond 🙇 negatively to it.
